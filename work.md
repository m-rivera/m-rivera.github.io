# Work

## Introduction

<p>I am a Computational Chemist, I write computer programs to model atoms and how they make up molecules and materials. As a Lecturer in Teaching at UCL, I participate in anything to do with Computational Chemistry to undergraduate and postgraduate students of the Chemsitry Department. I am interested in any project which involves programming, maths, and creativity, with benevolent ends.</p>

<p>If you would be interested in collaborating with me in a work capacity, please email me at <a href="mailto:miguel.rivera@ucl.ac.uk">this address</a>. You can find my CV <a href="Miguel_Rivera_CV.pdf">here</a> and my doctoral thesis <a href="files/thesis.pdf">here</a>.</p>

## Professional History

<ul>
    <li><b>Lecturer (Teaching)</b>, University College London, 01/2022 - <br/>
    <li><b>Associate Lecturer (Teaching)</b>, University College London, 02/2021 - 12/2021<br/>
    I am involved in any teaching to do with Computational Chemistry or
    Programming in the Chemistry Department at UCL, London, UK. I also help
    developing E-learning resources to help students and the rest of the
    teaching staff remain connected.</li>
    <li><b>Research Associate</b>, Imperial College London, 04/2020 - 01/2021<br/>
    I work in the Materials Design group, with Aron Walsh. The <a href="http://wmd-group.github.io/">group</a> has a variety of interests, and I focus on software development for several applications. We work in the Department of Materials, at Imperial College London, in South Kensington, London, UK.</li>
     <li><b>Doctoral Researcher</b>, Queen Mary University of London, 10/2016 - 03/2020<br/>
    I develop modelling strategies which allow the simulation of materials which interact with light. I then implement these strategies in <a href="https://github.com/m-rivera">open source programs</a> which enable the design of new better materials for solar panels, lasers, and LEDs. My advisor is Dr Rachel Crespo-Otero, and <a href="https://crespootero.wordpress.com/">our group</a> is located at Queen Mary University of London (QMUL), UK.</li>
    <li><b>Teaching Demonstrator</b>, Queen Mary University of London, 10/2016 - 03/2020<br/>
    I assist lecturers in the School of Biological and Chemical Sciences of QMUL. I am typically a demonstrator, meaning that I help students in their computational practicals. Notably, I have taught <i>Introduction to Scientific Programming</i>, which teaches undergraduate students how to write Python from scratch, and <i>Computational Chemistry</i>, which teaches students how to use Linux, and software for simulating chemical phenomena.</li>
    <li><b>Jazz Guitarist</b>, Happy Hour Collective, 10/2014 - 2018<br/>
    I am a semi-professional guitarist, playing occasional performances in the UK. I am a member of <i>The Martinis</i>, a part of <i><a href="http://www.hhcollective.co.uk/">The Happy Hour Collective</a></i>. We are a function band which plays the regular funk and soul repertoire for weddings, office parties, and other events. We also reinvents popular hits into new genres (<i>Smoke on the Water</i> as bossa nova, <i>Smells Like Teen Spirit</i> as swing etc.).</li></ul>

## Education

<ul>
    <li><b>PhD in Computational Chemistry</b>, Queen Mary University of London, UK, 10/2016 - 04/2020</li>
    <li><b>MSci in Physics</b>, University College London, UK, 10/2012 - 05/2016</li>
    <li><b>French Baccalaureate with International Option in English</b>, Lyc√©e International des Pontonniers, Strasbourg, France, 09/2009 - 07/2012</li>
</ul>
