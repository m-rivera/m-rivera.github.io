<h2 id="instructions">1. Instructions</h2>
<p>Below is a series of tasks involving performing and analysing calculations in order to gain some chemical insight. You must complete the tasks and submit a 2 to 3 page report based on them. The report must contain three main sections:</p>
<h3 id="introduction">1.1. Introduction</h3>
<p>Here, you will briefly comment on the possible uses for computational modelling in Chemistry and you will present the structure of your report.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>10/100</strong>
<ul>
<li>5/10 for clarity and presentation</li>
<li>5/10 for understanding the role of Computational Chemistry</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="methods">1.2. Methods</h3>
<p>Here, you will detail <em>how</em> to carry out the work youâ€™ve done. The detail should be enough to allow a classmate with no experience in Computational Chemistry to reproduce your results.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>30/100</strong>
<ul>
<li>15/30 for clarity and presentation</li>
<li>15/30 for completeness (did you cover each element of each calculation?)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="results">1.3. Results</h3>
<p>Here, you will report and discuss the results of each of the tasks.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>50/100</strong> (10/100 for each of the first three taskts, double for the final one)
<ul>
<li>4/10 for clarity and presentation</li>
<li>4/10 for linking the calculations with chemical knowledge</li>
<li>2/10 for accuracy of the results</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>A final <strong>10/100</strong> will be awarded for overall coherence of your report (consistent typesetting, transitions between sections etc.).</p>
<h2 id="tasks">2. Tasks</h2>
<p>For the first three calculations, use NWChem with the B3LYP functional and the basis set 3-21G. For 2.4., useGaussian with HF (Hartree-Fock) and the basis set 3-21G.</p>
<h3 id="pyridine">2.1. Pyridine</h3>
<p>Pyridine has three symmetrically unique carbon sites. Which of these sites would allow an electrophilic substitution, an which ones would allow a nucleophilic substitution?</p>
<p>Base your answer on the distribution of charge around the molecule.</p>
<h3 id="butadiene-and-ethene">2.2. Butadiene and ethene</h3>
<p>Report the reaction energy for the Diels-Adler reaction between butadiene and ethene, producing cyclohexene.</p>
<p>Is this reaction allowed under frontier molecular orbital theory? Include a visualisation of the frontier orbitals involved for your explanation.</p>
<h3 id="propene-and-hydrobromic-acid">2.3. Propene and hydrobromic acid</h3>
<p>Propene and hydrobromic acid can react to produce 1-bromopropane or 2-bromopropane. Report the reaction energies for both cases. Which one will be favoured? Which rule does this reflect for addition reactions?</p>
<h3 id="cyclohexane-conformers">2.4. Cyclohexane conformers</h3>
<p><strong>Warning:</strong> for these calculations, use Gaussian with HF 3-21G.</p>
<p>Cyclohexane has three stable conformers: chair, twist, and boat. Compare the energies and geometry of each conformer, using descriptive bond lengths, bond angles, and dihedral angles.</p>
<p>Probe the potential energy surface of the isomerisation between chair and twist by performing a relaxed scan of a tactically chosen dihedral angle coordinate. In order to find the transition that you care about, you will likely have to freeze another dihedral angle.</p>
<p>First, sample 4 points along the relevant coordinate: chair, boat, and two in-between points. Identify the point of highest energy, and the points at either side: A and B.</p>
<p>Then, perform a finer scan of four points around the peak: A, B, and two in-between points.</p>
<p>Plot all of your calculated points as a potential energy surface. What is the energy barrier for isomerisation?</p>
