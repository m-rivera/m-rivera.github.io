    <h2>What is the MOG?</h2>

    <p>
    Miguel's Online Grimoire (<b>MOG</b>) is a repository of Miguel Rivera's professional outputs and personal projects. It is written in a way that is accessible to most unsuspecting victims that may fall within its folds.
    The purposes of the <b>MOG</b> are to:
    <ul>
        <li>Offer a portrait of Miguel, the Well-Meaning Warlock (<b>MWMW</b>, pronounced 'moo-moo'), for anyone intersted in collaborating with him.</li>
        <li>Store ancient knowledge that <b>MWMW</b> is likely to forget.</li>
        <li>Disseminate the wizardry that <b>MWMW</b> has learned to explain well.</li>
        <li>Provide a platform for <b>MWMW</b>'s corpus of creative machinations.</li>
    </ul>
